About notebooks: 
<ul>
  <li><b>k-fold.iypnb</b> - for explaining difference between KFold and StratifiedKFold</li>
  <li><b>EDA.ipynb</b> - exploratory data analysis</li>
  <li><b>functions.ipynb</b> - for defining functions used in other notebooks</li>
  <li><b>preprocessing_ccfd.ipynb</b> - notebook where we prepare data, like reading the file of splitting data into training and test datasets</li>
  <li><b>full_data_ccfd.ipynb</b> - notebook in which we use orignial dataset for training (no resampling mathods applied)</li>
  <li><b>undersampling_ccfd.ipynb</b> - notebook in which we use undersampled data for training (mostly random undersampling, also outliers removed random undersampling)
  <li><b>oversampling_ccfd.ipynb</b> - notebook in which we use oversampled data for training (random oversampling, SMOTE. BorderlineSMOTE. ADASYN)
  <li><b>over_under_combination.ipynb</b> - notebook where we combined more than one resampling technique - (some combine oversampling and undersampling, some combine 2 undersampling)
