<ul>
  <li>k-fold.iypnb - for explaining difference between KFold and StratifiedKFold</li>
  <li>EDA.ipynb - exploratory data analysis</li>
  <li>functions.ipynb - for defining functions used in other notebooks</li>
  <li>preprocessing_ccfd.ipynb - notebook where we prepare data, like reading the file of splitting data into training and test datasets</li>
  <li>full_data_ccfd.ipynb - notebook in which we use orignial dataset for training (no resampling mathods applied)</li>
  <li>undersampling_ccfd.ipynb - notebook in which we use undersampled data for training (mostly random undersampling, also outliers removed random undersampling)
  <li>oversampling_ccfd.ipynb - notebook in which we use oversampled data for training (random oversampling, SMOTE. BorderlineSMOTE. ADASYN)
  <li>over_under_combination.ipynb - notebook where we combined more than one resampling technique - (some combine oversampling and undersampling, some combine 2 undersampling)
